#### Review Question 1.3.3 \(What Gauss-Markov does not mean\)

Under Assumptions 1.1–1.4, does there exist a linear, but not necessarily unbiased, estimator of $$\boldsymbol{\beta}$$ that has a variance smaller than that of the OLS estimator? If so, how small can the variance be?

**Solution**

If an estimator of $$\boldsymbol{\beta}$$ is a constant, then the estimator is trivially linear in $$\mathbf{y}$$.
