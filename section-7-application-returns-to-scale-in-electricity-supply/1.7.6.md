#### Review Question 1.7.6

Why is the $$R^2$$ of 0.926 from the unrestricted model \(1.7.7\) _lower_ than the $$R^2$$ of 0.932 from the restricted model \(1.7.8\)?

**Solution**

That is because the dependent variable in the restricted regression is different from that in the unrestricted regression. If the dependent variable were the same, then indeed the $$R^2$$ should be higher for the unrestricted model.
