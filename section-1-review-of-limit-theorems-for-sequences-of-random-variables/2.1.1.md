#### Review Question 2.1.1 \(Usual convergence vs. convergence in probability\)

A sequence of real numbers is a trivial example of a sequence of random variables. Is it true that

$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} z_n = \alpha
\implies
\operatorname*{plim}_{n \to \infty} z_n = \alpha ?
$$

**Hint**: Look at the definition of $$\operatorname{plim}$$. Since $$\lim_{n \to \infty} z_n = \alpha$$, $$| z_n - \alpha | < \varepsilon$$ for $$n$$ sufficiently large.

**Solution**

By definition, $$\lim_{n \to \infty} z_n = \alpha$$ means, for any $$\varepsilon > 0$$, for $$n$$ sufficiently large,

$$
| z_n - \alpha | < \varepsilon.
\tag{1}
$$

Considering $$z_n$$ as a trivial random variable, \(1\) is equivalent to

$$
\begin{gather}
\operatorname{Prob} (| z_n - \alpha | < \varepsilon) = 1, \\
\operatorname{Prob} (| z_n - \alpha | > \varepsilon) = 0, \\
\lim_{n \to \infty} \operatorname{Prob} (| z_n - \alpha | > \varepsilon) = 0.
\tag{2}
\end{gather}
$$

Then $$\operatorname*{plim}_{n \to \infty} z_n = \alpha$$ by definition.

**Appendix**

A sequence of random scalars $${z_n}$$ converges in probability to a constant $$\alpha$$ if, for any $$\varepsilon > 0$$,

$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} \operatorname{Prob} ( | z_n - \alpha | > \varepsilon ) = 0.
$$
