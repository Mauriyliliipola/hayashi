#### Review Question 1.2.6 \(Change in units and $$R^2$$\)

Does a change in the unit of measurement for the dependent variable change $$R^2$$? A change in the unit of measurement for the regressors? **Hint:** Check whether the change affects the denominator and the numerator in the definition for $$R^2$$.

**Solution**

By definition,

$$
R^2 = \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^n (\hat{y}_i - \bar{y})^2 }
{ \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \bar{y})^2 }.
$$

\(1\) If we change the unit of measurement of the dependent variable $$y$$, then $$y_i$$, $$\hat{y}_i$$, and $$\bar{y}$$ simultaneously scales by a factor $$\alpha$$. Both the denominator and the numerator are scaled by $$\alpha^2$$, leaving $$R^2$$ unchanged.

\(2\) If we change the unit of measurement of the regressors, then $$y_i$$, $$\hat{y}_i$$, and $$\bar{y}$$ donnot change at all. $$R^2$$ remains unchanged.
