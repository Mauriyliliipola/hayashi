#### Review Question 1.2.2

Verify that $$\mathbf{X}' \mathbf{X} / n = \frac{1}{n} \sum_i \mathbf{x}_i \mathbf{x}_i'$$ and $$\mathbf{X}' \mathbf{y} / n = \frac{1}{n} \sum_i \mathbf{x}_i y_i$$.

**Solution**

By the [outer-way](../../supplements/matrix-multiplication.md) matrix multiplication rule, noticing that $$\mathbf{x}_i$$ is the $$i$$th column vector of $$\mathbf{X}'$$, above equations are obviously true.
