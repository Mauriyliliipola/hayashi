#### Review Question 1.4.6 \($$t$$ vs. $$F$$\)

“It is nonsense to test a hypothesis consisting of a large number of equality restrictions, because the $$t$$-test will most likely reject at least some of the restrictions.” Criticize this statement.

**Solution**

A joint test of multiple restrictions _simultaneously_ is different from _separately_ test multiple restrictions. As explained in the text, the overall significance increases with the number of restrictions to be tested if the $$t$$-test is applied to each restriction without adjusting the critical value.
