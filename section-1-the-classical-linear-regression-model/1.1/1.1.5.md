#### Review Question 1.1.5 \(Multicollinearity for the simple regression model\)

Show that Assumption 1.3 for the simple regression model is that the nonconstant regressor \($$x_{i2}$$\) is really nonconstant \(i.e. $$x_{i2} \neq x_{j2}$$ for some pairs of $$(i, j)$$, $$i \neq j$$, with probability one\).

**Solution**

The simple regression model is

$$
\mathbf{y} = \beta_1 \cdot \mathbf{1} + \beta_2 \mathbf{x}_2 + \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}.
$$

Assumption 1.3 requires that $$\{ \mathbf{1}, \mathbf{x}_2 \}$$ are linearly independent with probability one. This means $$\mathbf{x}_2$$ is not proportional to $$\mathbf{1}$$ with probability one, i.e., $$x_{i2} \neq x_{j2}$$ for some pairs of $$(i, j)$$, $$i \neq j$$, with probability one.
