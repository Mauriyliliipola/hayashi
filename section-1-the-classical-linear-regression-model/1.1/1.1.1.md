#### Review Question 1.1.1 \(Change in units in the semi-log form\)

In the wage equation

$$
\log ( WAGE_i ) = \beta_1 + \beta_2 S_i + \beta_3 TENURE_i + \beta_4 EXPR_i + \varepsilon_i,
\tag{1.1.3}
$$

of Example 1.2, if $$WAGE$$ is measured in cents rather than in dollars, what difference does it make to the equation?

**Solution**

Let $$WAGE'$$ denote the $$WAGE$$ variable measured in cents, that is,

$$
WAGE' = 100 WAGE,
$$

$$
\log ( WAGE' ) = \log (100) + \log ( WAGE ).
$$

Substituting into equation \(1.1.3\),

$$
\log ( WAGE_i') - \log (100) = \beta_1 + \beta_2 S_i +
\beta_3 TENURE_i + \beta_4 EXPR_i +
\varepsilon_i,
$$

$$
\log (\mathit{WAGE}_i') = \log (100) + \beta_1 + \beta_2 S_i +
\beta_3 \mathit{TENURE}_i + \beta_4 \mathit{EXPR}_i +
\varepsilon_i,
$$

$$
\log ( WAGE_i') = \beta_1' + \beta_2 S_i + \beta_3
 TENURE_i + \beta_4 EXPR_i + \varepsilon_i,
$$

where $$\beta_1'$$ is defined as $$\beta_1' = \log (100) + \beta_1$$. So the _only_ difference is $$\beta_1$$ is increased by $$\log (100)$$.
